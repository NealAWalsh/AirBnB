# AirBnB
Presenting a dataset of AirBnB properties in Seattle, WA from 2016 using Tableau.

A client wants to buy a property in Seattle which they could put onto AirBnB when they are not living there. Using data taken from AirBnB in 2016, I have created a dashboard to help the client decide on the location and size of property they may wish to pursue.

Follow the link to the [interactive dashboard](https://nealawalsh.github.io/AirBnB/).

Using this dashboard, we can arrive at the following conclusions:
* 1-bedroom properties dominate the market, with very few 6-bedroom properties available to rent.
* The best time of year to make a property available to customers to maximise earnings is during holiday periods, starting around Easter, with higher increases during the summer months, peaking in June and then again in December over the winter holidays.
* The most income can be made from properties in the 98101 Zipcode.
* The more rooms the property has the more can be charged to rent.
